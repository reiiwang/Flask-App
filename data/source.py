        "context": "Prediabetes is a health condition that means your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough for you to be diagnosed with diabetes. The blood sugar range for prediabetes is 100-125 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L), and the A1c range is 5.7% to 6.4%. The A1c averages your blood sugar over 2 to 3 months. Prediabetes usually has no symptoms, but it almost always shows up before you get diagnosed with diabetes. About 86 million people in the U. S. over age 20 have prediabetes. And doctors see the need to diagnose it more often. Treating it can prevent more serious health problems later on. These range from type 2 diabetes to problems with your heart, blood vessels, eyes, and kidneys. By the time you're diagnosed with diabetes, many of these problems have already taken hold. Although most people with prediabetes have no symptoms, you might notice: You're extra thirsty. You pee a lot. Your vision is blurry. You're extremely tired. You're most likely to get this disease if you: Had gestational diabetes or gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds Have polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS) Are African- American, Native American, Latino, or Pacific Islander Are overweight or obese, especially around the middle (belly fat) Have high cholesterol, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and high LDL cholesterol Don't exercise Are older; people over age 45 are most likely to get it. Have a waist larger than 40 inches if you're a man and 35 inches if you're a woman. Eat red and processed meat, or drink sugary beverages but skimp on fruit, veggies, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil Have a sleep problem, like sleep apnea, or you work changing shifts or night shifts Get tested for prediabetes if you meet the criteria above and you: Had an abnormal blood sugar reading in the past Have heart disease Show signs of insulin resistance, which means your body produces insulin but doesn't respond to it the way it should Your doctor can do one of three different blood tests -- the fasting plasma glucose test, the oral glucose tolerance test, or the hemoglobin A1c test. Fasting plasma glucose test: You won't eat for 8 hours before thig blood test. The results are: Normal if your blood sugar is less than 100 mg/d L Prediabetes if your blood sugar is 100-125 mg/d L Diabetes if your blood sugar is 126 or higher mg/d L Oral glucose tolerance test: First, you'll take the fasting glucose test. Then you'll drink a sugary solution. Two hours after that, you'll take another blood test. The results are: Normal if your blood sugar is less than 140 mg/d L after the second test Prediabetes if your blood sugar is 140-199 mg/d L after the second test Diabetes if your blood sugar is 200 mg/d L or higher after the second test Hemoglobin A1c test: This blood test shows your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months. Doctors can use it to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. Or if you already know you have diabetes, it helps show whether it's under control. The results are: Normal: 5.6% or less Prediabetes: 5.7 to 6.4% Diabetes: 6.5% or above You may need to take the test again to confirm the results. Treatment for prediabetes is simple: Eat a healthy diet and lose weight. Losing 5% to 10% of your weight can make a huge difference. Exercise. Choose something that you enjoy, like walking. Try to get at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. You can start with less time and work your way up to a half-hour if you need to. Check with your doctor before you do more than that. Stop smoking. Treat high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Take medication like metformin ( Glucophage) to lower blood sugar if you're at high risk of diabetes. There's no official diet, but four simple changes can reverse prediabetes and lower your risk of type 2 diabetes: Choose whole grains and whole-grain products over processed carbs like white bread, potatoes, and breakfast cereals. Drink coffee, water, and tea instead of sugary drinks. Opt for good fats like those in vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds over those in margarine, baked goods, and fried foods. Trade red meat and processed meats for nuts, whole grains, poultry, and fish."

        "context": "If your allergies act up when you're at home, your bedroom is probably one of your problem areas. It's key to make the room less cozy to mold, dust mites, and other allergens that make you sneeze and sniffle. It's time to take action. These microscopic bugs can trigger allergies and asthma. They can often be found living in your bedding. You can take some steps to get rid of them: Put dust-mite-proof covers on pillows, comforters, mattresses, and box springs. Wash your blankets, sheets, and pillowcases every week in water that is at least 130 F. Dry everything in a hot dryer. Carpet is a popular place for dust mites. Consider replacing it in your bedroom with hardwood floors or linoleum and washable area rugs. If you must have carpet in your bedroom: Choose the low-nap or low-pile kind, which holds fewer allergens. Clean it using a vacuum with a HEPA filter and a double bag every week. Wear a dust mask while you vacuum so you don't inhale dust that floats up into the air. Say goodbye to dust catchers like blinds and heavy, dry-clean-only drapes. Try washable curtains and roller shades, instead. Wipe window frames and glass regularly to prevent mold and mildew. Both can trigger upper respiratory symptoms if you have allergies or asthma. Keep things simple to breathe better. Cut back on knickknacks and fabric. The less upholstery in the room, the better. Move books, magazines, and decorative items to another room, so you can dust less often. Don't store things under your bed. Dust mites and mold like a warm, damp room, but you probably don't. When it's warm, use your air conditioner, even if you're tempted by the outdoor breeze. If you live in a sweaty-weather climate, use a dehumidifier to keep humidity at 30% to 50%. Turn down the heat or turn up the AC. Dust mites can't breed as well at temperatures below 77 F. You may want to try an air-filtration system that uses a small-particle or HEPA filter to keep the air in your bedroom cleaner. These filters work in central air conditioning and heating systems and in portable AC units. Your pets may love to snuggle with you. But dander, saliva, and pee from furry animals can carry allergens. Ideally, your dog or cat should sleep somewhere else. If not, do your best to reduce dander. For example, vacuum more often. These scurrying insects might make an appearance no matter where you live -- and they leave behind tiny droppings that can bring on symptoms for people with asthma, especially children. To keep roaches outside of your home: Seal cracks and crevices. Fix leaks in pipes and faucets. Try not to leave wet towels on the floor. Roaches thrive on water. Store food in tightly sealed containers. Keep your dishes clean. Hire an exterminator if you need to."

It's called swine flu because in the past, the people who caught it had direct contact with pigs. That changed several years ago, when a new virus emerged that spread among people who hadn't been near pigs. In 2009, H1 N1 was spreading fast around the world, so the World Health Organization called it a pandemic. Since then, people have continued to get sick from swine flu, but not as many. While swine flu isn't as scary as it seemed a few years ago, it's still important to protect yourself from getting it. Like seasonal flu, it can cause more serious health problems for some people. The best bet is to get a flu vaccine, or flu shot, every year. Swine flu is one of the viruses included in the vaccine. The same way as the seasonal flu. When people who have it cough or sneeze, they spray tiny drops of the virus into the air. If you come in contact with these drops, touch a surface (like a doorknob or sink) where the drops landed, or touch something an infected person has recently touched, you can catch H1 N1 swine flu. People who have it can spread it one day before they have any symptoms and as many as 7 days after they get sick. Kids can be contagious for as long as 10 days. Despite the name, you can't catch swine flu from eating bacon, ham, or any other pork product. These, too, are pretty much the same as seasonal flu. They can include: Cough Fever Sore throat Stuffy or runny nose Body aches Headache Chills Fatigue Like the regular flu, swine flu can lead to more serious problems including pneumonia, a lung infection, and other breathing problems. And it can make an illness like diabetes or asthma worse. If you have symptoms like shortness of breath, severe vomiting, pain in your belly or sides, dizziness, or confusion, call your doctor or 911 right away. Yes. Without one it's hard to tell whether you have swine flu or seasonal flu, because most symptoms are the same. If you have swine flu, you may be more likely to feel sick and your stomach and throw up than with regular flu. But a lab test is the only way to know. Even a rapid flu test you can get in your doctor's office won't tell you for sure. To test for swine flu, your doctor runs a swab -- a bigger version of the ones in your bathroom -- up the inside of your nose around the back of your throat. But the test isn't as common or widespread as those for regular flu. So the only people who really need to be tested are those in the hospital or those at high risk for life-threatening problems from swine flu, such as: Children under 5 years old People 65 or older Children and teens (under age 18) who are getting long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for Reye's syndrome after being infected with swine flu. Reye's syndrome is a life-threatening illness linked to aspirin use in children. Pregnant women Adults and children with chronic lung, heart, liver, blood, nervous system, neuromuscular, or metabolic problems Adults and children who have weakened immune systems (including those who take medications to suppress their immune systems or who have HIV) People in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities Some of the same antiviral drugs that are used to treat seasonal flu also work against H1 N1 swine flu. Oseltamivir ( Tamiflu), peramivir ( Rapivab), and zanamivir ( Relenza) seem to work best, although some kinds of swine flu don't respond to oseltamivir. These drugs can help you get well faster. They can also make you feel better. They work best when you take them within 48 hours of the first flu symptoms, but they can help even if you get them later on. Antibiotics won't do anything for you. That's because flu is caused by a virus, not bacteria. Over-the-counter pain remedies and cold and flu medications can help relieve aches, pains, and fever. Don't give aspirin to children under age 18 because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. Make sure that over-the-counter cold medications do not have aspirin before giving them to children. The same flu vaccine that protects against seasonal flu also protects against the H1 N1 swine flu strain. You can get it as a shot or as a nasal spray. Either way, it \"teaches\" your immune system to attack the real virus. Besides a flu shot, there are other things you can do to stay healthy: Wash your hands throughout the day with soap and water. Sing the \" Happy Birthday\" song twice to make sure you've washed long enough. Or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Avoid people who are sick."

        "context": "This is one of several kinds of oral (mouth) cancers. Like other cancers, it happens when cells divide out of control and form a growth, or tumor. There are two types. One is called oral tongue cancer because it affects the part you can stick out. The other happens at the base of your tongue, where it connects to your throat. This type is often diagnosed after it has spread to the lymph nodes in your neck. Tongue cancer is less common than many other types. Most people who get it are older adults. It's rare in children. One of the first signs of tongue cancer is a lump or sore on the side of your tongue that doesn't go away. It may be pinkish-red in color. Sometimes the sore will bleed if you touch or bite it. You may also have: Pain in or near your tongue Changes in your voice, like sounding hoarse Trouble swallowing If you have a sore on your tongue or in your mouth that doesn't get better in a couple of weeks, see your doctor. If the problem is at the base of your tongue, you may not notice any symptoms. Your dentist may find signs of tongue cancer during a checkup, or your doctor might notice something during a regular exam. The human papillomavirus ( HPV) can cause cancers on the base of the tongue. HPV also can infect your genital area and cause cervical cancer, penile cancer, and anal cancer. It's the most common sexually transmitted infection. There are many types of HPV. The ones that raise your odds of getting cancer are called high-risk HPV. Other things that may raise your chances of getting tongue cancer include: Tobacco use Alcohol use Jagged teeth Not taking care of your teeth and gums Your genes also may play a role in whether you're likely to get tongue cancer. Your doctor will examine your mouth and ask questions about your symptoms. He may recommend an X-ray or CT (computerized tomography) scan -- several X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to show a more detailed picture. He also may take a sample of tissue from your mouth to test (a biopsy). Your treatment will depend on where your tumor is and how big it is. Surgery is often the best way to remove a tumor from the part of your tongue you can see. Your doctor will probably take out some healthy tissue and nearby lymph nodes as well, to make sure all the cancer is gone. If the cancer is on the back of your tongue, you may have radiation therapy ( X-rays and other radiation). Sometimes the best treatment is a combination of chemotherapy, or cancer-fighting drugs, and radiation. You might need therapy afterward to help you chew, move your tongue, swallow, and speak better. You'll need regular checkups to make sure the cancer hasn't come back. We know that many cases of base-of-the-tongue cancer are caused by HPV. Some things that may make you less likely to get this type of cancer are: If you're not sexually active, get vaccinated for HPV. If you are sexually active, use latex condoms every time you have sex. Don't use tobacco in any form. Avoid heavy or frequent alcohol use. Take good care of your teeth and gums."

        "context": "When you live with nerve pain from peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes, it's normal to feel down sometimes. You'll probably have to deal with fear, anger, denial, disappointment, guilt, or loneliness. But there's room for hope, because the right treatment and lifestyle changes can bring you relief. Your doctor may prescribe medications that treat depression. These drugs can pull double duty, easing the physical pain and its emotional effects. Talk with your diabetes doctors before you take this kind of drug, though. Some of these meds can cause weight gain, which could make it harder to control your blood sugar. Also consider trying psychotherapy if you're diagnosed with depression. Talking with a therapist will let you sort out problems or events in your life that may have led to depression. This can help you solve problems, regain a sense of control over your life, and help you enjoy it again. Here are more ways to handle the emotions related to your diabetes and nerve pain: Learn how to relax. Try deep breathing and other relaxation techniques like meditation. Set reachable goals. Don't try to overdo things on good days. Learn to pace yourself. Don't put yourself down. If you do, just notice that you're being harsh, and think of something positive about yourself instead. Make time for de-stressing. You need exercise and relaxation every day. Join a chronic pain support group. It often helps to share your feelings. Don't drink alcohol. Pain often disrupts sleep. So does alcohol. Quit smoking . Research shows that smokers are at higher risk for pain in general. Also, smoking worsens peripheral neuropathy. The American Pain Society and the National Pain Foundation both offer local support groups in many areas. You can meet people facing the same challenges as you. Plus, you can learn what pain-relieving tricks work for them. For example, some people say wearing socks to bed can help. You can also ask them if they've taken medications that have helped. If you're in a relationship, be candid with your partner. Discuss any fears you have about intimacy, be it fear of rejection, or pain from sex. Also discuss what's good, and be frank about what you need. Make time to be by yourselves, too. Take a bath together, go for a walk, or just hold each other in bed. If you're having sexual problems, consider seeing a counselor or sex therapist."

        "context": "Got game? If you play too long, you might have gamer's thumb, too. Its proper name is de Quervain's tenosynovitis, but you could also hear it called de Quervain's disease or de Quervain's syndrome. It's a painful inflammation of tendons in your wrist and lower thumb. When the swollen tendons rub against the narrow tunnel they pass through, it causes pain at the base of your thumb and into the lower arm. Doctors often don't know why you get de Quervain's tenosynovitis. But it does result from: A direct blow to the thumb Gaming Hobbies like gardening or racket sports Inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis Overuse Repetitive workplace tasks Anyone can get de Quervain's tenosynovitis. But these things make it more likely: Age. Adults between 30 and 50 are most likely to get it. Gender. Women are 8 to 10 times more likely to get it than men. Motherhood. It often happens just after pregnancy. Lifting your little bundle of joy repeatedly might bring it on. Motions. You can get the condition if you move your wrist over and over again, whether it's for fun or for work. If you have de Quervain's, you'll probably notice: Pain along the back of your thumb, directly over the two tendons. Swelling and pain at the base of your thumb Swelling and pain on the side of your wrist The condition can happen gradually or start suddenly. In either case, the pain may travel into your thumb or up your forearm. It may be hard and painful to move your thumb, particularly when you try to pinch or grasp things. The pain may get worse when you move your thumb or wrist. The doctor will check your hand to see if it hurts when he puts pressure on the thumb side of your wrist. Next, you'll get the Finkelstein test. The doctor will ask you to bend your thumb across your palm. Then you'll bend your fingers down over your thumb to make a fist. This movement stretches your tendons. If it hurts on the thumb side of your wrist, you probably have de Quervain's tenosynovitis. The goal is to ease the pain and inflammation when you move your thumb and to stop it from happening again. It involves: Medications. You'll start with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to ease the swelling. If that doesn't work, your doctor may inject steroids into the tight covering, or sheath, that surrounds your tendon. If you do this within 6 months after you notice symptoms, you might fully recover with no more treatment. Splint and physical therapy. Your doctor will probably order a splint that will hold your thumb and wrist firm and still. You'll wear it 24 hours a day for 4 to 6 weeks. You will also receive therapy to teach you exercises to build strength in your wrist, hand, and arm. Surgery. If these treatments don't help, your doctor may recommend surgery. The operation releases the tendon sheath so your tendon can move smoothly. It's an outpatient procedure, which means you go home just afterward. You'll probably see the physical therapist again for post-surgery exercises to strengthen your thumb and wrist. Home remedies and lifestyle changes. See your doctor if you think you have de Quervain's. But try these methods at home to feel better and keep your thumb healthy: Ice the area to ease inflammation. Stop doing anything that makes it worse. Avoid repeated motions and pinching moves with your fingers and thumb. Wear the splint as long as your doctor tells you to. Keep doing your exercises. If you didn't need surgery, you'll probably get better in 4-6 weeks if you wear your splint, do your exercises, and avoid movements that irritate your tendon. Recovery from surgery could take a while. Your pain and swelling should go away soon, but the area may be tender for several months. You should get your stitches out in 10 to 14 days. Then you'll start physical therapy again for 6 to 8 weeks. You'll learn stretches to help your tendons move properly and exercises to strengthen your muscles and keep your joints steady."

        "context": "For more than three decades, care for small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC) remained mostly the same. That's changing now -- doctors have a new option called immunotherapy. This line of treatment uses your body's own immune system to fight cancer. What Is Immunotherapy? The immune system is your body's defense against harmful substances. It attacks foreign particles, like germs and viruses. But cancer can confuse your body. As cells change and grow out of control, your immune system may not think them as a threat. Scientists have developed drugs to help your immune system target and destroy cancerous cells. They include: Immune checkpoint inhibitors: Some immune cells have proteins that act as off switches. These \u00e2\u0080\u009ccheckpoints\u00e2\u0080\u009d prevent them from killing cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors target these proteins and allow immune cells to attack the cancer. Cancer vaccines: These substances kick-start an immune system response. They can prevent or treat certain cancers. Scientists are beginning to study vaccines for SCLC. Which Drugs Treat SCLC? There are a few FDA-approved immunotherapy drugs for SCLC. Nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda). You might take these immune checkpoint inhibitors if your cancer doesn't respond or returns after treatment with a certain chemotherapy. Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq). You might take this immune checkpoint inhibitor along with chemotherapy. When Do You Get Immunotherapy? Depending on how much your cancer has spread, your cancer doctor will usually recommend treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. But SCLC is an aggressive disease that grows quickly. It often becomes resistant to the chemotherapy drugs. Most of the time, the cancer returns. That's when it's time to try immunotherapy. Because scientists are still studying the drugs, doctors are careful about when to prescribe them. They can cause serious side effects, like inflammation of the organs. Your doctor will weigh the pros and cons. Most people get immunotherapy after two or more rounds of chemotherapy. How Do You Get the Treatment? You go to your doctor's office, a clinic, or the outpatient unit of a hospital. An IV will deliver the immunotherapy into your vein. The process usually takes around an hour. Depending on the drug, you'll receive treatment every few weeks. Your doctor will decide how long you'll get this medication. Usually the goal of is to prevent the cancer from getting worse instead of curing the disease."

        "context": "Dry eye can come on for a lot of reasons, from staring at your computer for too long to simply getting older. But another cause could be one of the medicines you take every day. Many common drugs have dry eye as a side effect. Medications lead to dry eye in many ways. They can cut the number of tears you make or change the mix of ingredients in them. If you have severe acne that causes deep, painful cysts, you might take a drug called isotretinoin. It helps get rid of your acne by lowering the amount of oils made by certain glands. But some of those glands are in your eyelids, which leads to less oil in your tears. This may seem like a random collection of drugs, but they all have one thing in common: They block some signals between nerve cells. That's helpful when you want to treat depression or Parkinson's disease, but it can also stop the signals that would normally tell your eye to make more tears. Not all antidepressants work this way. Tricyclic antidepressants do, but SSRIs don't. Even so, SSRIs can also cause dry eyes. If you've got allergies to things like pollen, pet dander, or mold, antihistamines can feel like a lifesaver. They block your body's response to allergy triggers and prevent common symptoms like itching, sneezing, watery eyes, and a runny nose. But they might also cause your eyes to make fewer tears. That can lead to dry, irritated eyes. Hormones, like the ones used in birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy for menopause, can also cause dry eyes. Women who take only estrogen are much more likely to get dry eye than women who take both estrogen and progesterone. Doctors aren't sure exactly why hormones lead to dry eye, but it may be that they affect how much water goes into your tears. Beta-blockers are a common type of blood pressure medication. They block your body's response to the hormone adrenaline. That helps your blood pressure because it slows your heartbeat, which then lowers the force your blood puts on your arteries. One of the side effects is that your body makes less of one of the proteins that goes into your tears. That leads to fewer tears and dryer eyes. Beta-blockers can also lower the normal pressure in your eyes, which affects the amount of water in your tears, also a problem for dryness. Diuretics, also called water pills, are another medicine that's used for blood pressure. They help your body get rid of salt and water, which can also change the makeup of your tears. Other blood pressure medications, like ACE inhibitors and alpha blockers, don't typically affect your eyes. When a cold, flu, or allergies lead to a stuffy nose, you might find yourself reaching for a decongestant. They get the job done by reducing swelling in the blood vessels of your nose. As the swelling goes down, you have more room for air to flow so you can breathe freely again. But, like antihistamines, they may also cause your eyes to make fewer tears. It doesn't happen often, but even the common pain relievers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, can cause dry eye. Aspirin normally doesn't have this effect, but talk to your doctor about what might be best for you. Don't stop taking them right away. That could have harmful effects. Instead, talk to your doctor about it. The best solution depends on your health and which medicines you take. You may be able to: Change the dose of your medication. Some drugs are less likely to cause dry eye if taken in lower amounts. Switch to a different medicine that doesn't cause dry eye. Try different contacts. If dry eye from medicine makes it harder to wear contacts, a different kind of lens might provide relief. Use artificial tears to keep your eyes moist."

        "context": "When you have type 2 diabetes, you want to get the most bang for your exercise buck. You'll need to fuel up the right way before, during, and after you work out. If you can manage your diabetes with diet and exercise alone, you don't need a pre-workout snack any more than someone without the disease. But if you take insulin or a drug that pushes your pancreas to make it, you might have to think before you snack. What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar. If your reading is between 200 and 300 mg/dl and you've already eaten at least once that day, you probably don't need to eat anything. But you do need to check for ketones if it's over 250. Your body makes them when it burns fat for fuel instead of sugar. Don't exercise if you have them. If your reading is over 300, ask your doctor if exercise is OK. Otherwise, grab a snack with 15-30 grams of carbs. The lower your blood sugar is before you start and the longer you plan to work out, the larger your snack should be, up to 30 grams of carbs. You'll probably have to try a few options and amounts to see what works best. These snacks offer 15 grams of carbs with little prep time: 1 small piece of fresh fruit (4 ounces) 1 slice of bread (1 ounce) or 1 (6-inch) tortilla 1/2 cup of oatmeal 2/3 cup of plain fat-free yogurt or sweetened with sugar substitutes These have 30 grams of carbs: 1/2 peanut butter sandwich (1 slice whole wheat bread with 1 tablespoon peanut butter) and 1 cup milk 1 English muffin and 1 teaspoon low-fat margarine 3/4 cup whole grain, ready-to-eat cereal and 1/2 cup fat-free milk If your reading is below 150 mg/dl and you plan to work out for at least an hour, choose something with protein. These choices have it and less than 5 grams of carbs each: 15 almonds 1 tablespoon peanut butter 1 hard-boiled egg 1 piece of string cheese Many people with diabetes find that snacks with a ratio of 3 grams of carbs to 1 gram of protein work well. There's no need to take a protein supplement. Your food has enough. If you like to work out in the a.m., make sure you eat breakfast first, no matter what your blood sugar is. Exercising on an empty stomach in the morning can raise it. But food sends a signal to your pancreas to make insulin, which keeps it at a safe level. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise. If you're going to head out for a bike trip, marathon, or day-long hike, take some snacks with you. Food may not be easy to carry around if you're in a race. Glucose gels and tablets or sports drinks can be good options. Count the carbs like you would with food. Tip: Your body will absorb carbs more quickly if they're in liquids and gels. This can come in handy if you're going full tilt. Check your blood sugar every hour. How many carbs your snacks should have depends on how much longer you plan to exercise and what your reading says. The idea is to eat enough carbs to keep you from having a low reading or just plain conking out, but not so many that your levels spike. It may take a few tries to figure out the right balance. Test again. If it's less than 100 mg/dl, have a snack. If your next regularly scheduled meal or snack is 30-60 minutes later, 15 grams of carbs should hold you. If your next meal or snack is more than an hour away, have about 15 grams of carbs and 7 or 8 grams of protein. Your sugar level can drop for up to 24 hours after moderate or intense exercise. If it's still below 100 mg/dl at bedtime, double up on your snack. If you take insulin, ask your doctor if it's OK to lower your dose at bedtime. Even if you don't need a snack right after you work out, you'll still need to build your energy back to help your muscles recover. The best time to eat is between 30 minutes and 2 hours after you're done."

That condition (called gestational diabetes) or delivering a baby over 9 pounds can make you more likely to get type 2 diabetes. 10. You're a woman who has PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). 11. You're age 45 or older. The chance of getting type 2 diabetes rises with age. But diabetes isn't a normal part of aging. 12. You're Hispanic, African- American, Native American, or Asian American. Diabetes is more common among these groups. Talk with your doctor to get a better sense of your risk. He can help you make a plan that will keep you in good health."

        "context": "When you\u2019re sick, you want to get better as quickly as possible. But some of your habits may actually make your symptoms worse. Avoid these common cold and flu missteps so you can stay on the road to recovery. 1. You try to power through. Don\u2019t keep up with your usual routine. Your body needs energy to fight off that cold or flu virus. Make rest a priority. Cancel those plans and stay home from work or school. Along with helping your body recover, you\u2019ll also keep from spreading those germs around. 2. You ignore flu symptoms. You usually don\u2019t need to see a doctor for a run-of-the-mill cold. But call her if you have signs of the flu, such as a high fever, body aches, and fatigue. She can give you an antiviral drug such as oseltamivir ( Tamiflu) or zanamivir ( Relenza). If you take one in the first 48 hours that you\u2019re sick, you can ease your symptoms and shorten your illness by 1 or 2 days. 3. You skimp on sleep. Not getting enough weakens your immune system, which makes it harder for you to battle that infection. One study found that people who get less than 6 hours of shut-eye a night are four times more likely to get sick than those who log at least 7. So go to bed early and take naps during the day. Are your symptoms keeping you up? Soothe a nighttime cough with a little honey, and run a humidifier to help you breathe easier. 4. You bug your doctor for an antibiotic. That prescription won\u2019t make you feel better. Antibiotics only kill bacteria, and colds and the flu are caused by viruses. Nearly one-third of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. This can raise your risk of side effects, such as diarrhea and allergic reactions. It also contributes to a huge global health problem: antibiotic resistance. That\u2019s when bacteria get used to the drugs, so they don\u2019t work anymore. 5. You don\u2019t drink enough. When your throat aches, it\u2019s not as easy to gulp down liquids. But when you stay hydrated, you can thin your mucus and break up congestion. It can also fend off headaches. Make sure you drink plenty of water. For extra relief, sip a warm beverage like herbal tea or broth. Research shows that it can help ease cold symptoms such as fatigue or a sore throat. 6. You skip meals and snacks. You might not have much of an appetite, but it\u2019s important to eat something. Calories and nutrients will fuel the immune cells that attack cold and flu viruses. The result: You may get better faster. Try eating a bowl of chicken soup. Research shows that this classic may actually relieve some of those symptoms. 7. You light up. Smoking damages your lungs and irritates your throat. That can make your cold symptoms worse. So ditch the cigarettes and steer clear of secondhand smoke. 8. You stress out. A hormone your body makes when you\u2019re stressed is hard on the immune system. It also increases inflammation, which can make your stuffy nose even worse. Make an effort to focus on relaxing and recovering, and you may be back on your feet sooner."

        "context": "You've injured your ankle and can't put your weight on it. It hurts and is tender to the touch, bruised, and swollen. It could be a sprain, or it might be broken. The symptoms of an ankle sprain are a lot like a fracture, but you'll need to know which injury you have so you can heal the right way. This happens when you damage the ligaments in your ankle. Ligaments are the tough, stretchy bands that hold your bones in place and help keep the joint stable. They're meant to stretch and move, but only to a point. A sprain means that a ligament is torn or stretched beyond its limits. This happens when at least one of three bones in your ankle breaks. If just one bone is broken, you may not realize how bad the injury is. But if multiple bones break at once, you will lose stability in your ankle and may not be able to walk. An ankle fracture can also lead to ligament damage. To help figure out what the injury might be, ask yourself a few questions: Was there a noise when it happened? A sprain may occur silently, or in severe cases there may be a popping sound. With a fracture, you might hear a crack. Is your ankle misshapen? While swelling is a symptom of both injuries, if your ankle looks clearly \u00e2\u0080\u009coff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it's most likely because a bone is broken. Does your ankle feel numb? With a sprain, you feel pain. But if you have numbness or tingling, your ankle is most likely broken. Where is the pain? If your ankle hurts or is tender to the touch directly over your ankle bone, you probably have a fracture. If the pain is in the soft part of your ankle, it's more likely a sprain. If you're still not sure, see your doctor. He can examine your ankle and give you a number of tests to figure out which injury you have. It's usually less involved when you are healing from a sprain. Most sprains will clear up on their own. You may take anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve). And your doctor may advise you to try the \u00e2\u0080\u009c RICE\u00e2\u0080\u009d method to ease your inflammation: Rest Ice Compression (with an elastic bandage) Elevation (ankle above the heart) You may need physical therapy for a moderate sprain. You should start range of motion exercises once the pain and swelling subside. Surgery is usually for severe cases when other treatments have failed. If you think your ankle is broken, you should get medical treatment right away. You need to have the ankle immobilized. This could involve crutches or a cast. Your doctor may try to align the broken bones to help you heal. If the bones are unable to stay in place after your doctor has tried to stabilize the fracture, you might need surgery. You can also apply ice, elevate your ankle, and take pain relievers. Talk to your doctor. These can be vastly different for the two injuries as well. A sprain may clear up within days, with worse sprains needing several weeks to heal. Fractures usually take much longer. It could be 6 weeks to several months before you're back to your regular routine. For most ankle fractures, you can do your rehab with a basic home exercise program of stretching, range of motion, strengthening, and balance exercises."

        "context": "If you are suffering from insomnia, there are many steps you can take to change behaviors and lifestyle to help you get to sleep. Here are some tips for beating insomnia. Wake up at the same time each day. It is tempting to sleep late on weekends, especially if you have had poor sleep during the week. However, if you suffer from insomnia you should get up at the same time every day in order to train your body to wake at a consistent time. Eliminate alcohol and stimulants like nicotine and caffeine. The effects of caffeine can last for several hours, perhaps up to 24 hours, so the chances of it affecting sleep are significant. Caffeine may not only cause difficulty initiating sleep, but may also cause frequent awakenings. Alcohol may have a sedative effect for the first few hours following consumption, but it can then lead to frequent arousals and a non-restful night's sleep. If you are on medications that act as stimulants, such as decongestants or asthma inhalers, ask your doctor when they should best be taken to help minimize any affect on sleep. Limit naps. While napping seems like a proper way to catch up on missed sleep, it is not always so. It is important to establish and maintain a regular sleep pattern and train oneself to associate sleep with cues like darkness and a consistent bedtime. Napping can affect the quality of nighttime sleep. Exercise regularly. Regular exercise can improve sleep quality and duration. However, exercising immediately before bedtime can have a stimulant effect on the body and should be avoided. Try to finish exercising at least three hours before you plan to retire for the night. Limit activities in bed. The bed is for sleeping and having sex and that's it. If you suffer from insomnia, do not balance the checkbook, study, or make phone calls, for example, while in bed or even in the bedroom, and avoid watching television or listening to the radio. All these activities can increase alertness and make it difficult to fall asleep. Do not eat or drink right before going to bed. Eating a late dinner or snacking before going to bed can activate the digestive system and keep you up. If you suffer from gastroesophageal reflux ( GERD) or heartburn, it is even more important to avoid eating and drinking right before bed since this can make your symptoms worse. In addition, drinking a lot of fluids prior to bed can overwhelm the bladder, requiring frequent visits to the bathroom that disturb your sleep. Make your sleeping environment comfortable. Temperature, lighting, and noise should be controlled to make the bedroom conducive to falling (and staying) asleep. Your bed should feel comfortable and if you have a pet that sleeps in the room with you, consider having the pet sleep somewhere else if it tends to make noise in the night. Get all your worrying over with before you go to bed. If you find you lay in bed thinking about tomorrow, consider setting aside a period of time -- perhaps after dinner -- to review the day and to make plans for the next day. The goal is to avoid doing these things while trying to fall asleep. It is also useful to make a list of, say, work-related tasks for the next day before leaving work. That, at least, eliminates one set of concerns. Reduce stress. There are a number of relaxation therapies and stress reduction methods you may want to try to relax the mind and the body before going to bed. Examples include progressive muscle relaxation (perhaps with audio tapes), deep breathing techniques, imagery, meditation, and biofeedback. Consider participating in cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy helps some people with insomnia identify and correct inappropriate thoughts and beliefs that may contribute to insomnia. In addition, cognitive therapy can give you the proper information about sleep norms, age-related sleep changes, and help set reasonable sleep goals, among other things."

        "context": "The relationship between sleep and heart failure is a two-way street. Having heart failure means you're likely to have other health issues, including sleep problems. Likewise, sleep problems, including obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) and insomnia, can make your heart failure symptoms worse. A good night's sleep is important, whether your heart is healthy or not. Rest helps your heart as well as your energy levels, thinking skills, and overall health. If you can deal with your sleep problems, you may ease the burden on your heart. Complications of heart failure can affect your sleep. For example: Chest pain and discomfort make it hard to relax and fall or stay asleep. Lying in bed can make you feel short of breath. You may have to get up during the night to pee. During the day, you're standing and sitting, so extra fluid would normally settle in your legs and feet. But lie down, and it's going to move up into your chest and throat. This can close in your lungs and airway, making it harder to breathe. Your doctor might prescribe diuretics to help get rid of that extra fluid. But these medicines don't stop working when you sleep, which can mean interrupting your slumber for a trip or two to the bathroom. OSA is more common among people who are overweight, but anyone can get it. The tissue in the back of your throat relaxes and blocks your airway while you sleep. You stop breathing, so your brain signals your throat muscles to contract, which opens up your airway again. This can happen dozens or even hundreds of times a night. Your brain also releases stress hormones during these episodes. They can raise your heart rate and your blood pressure -- which raises your chance of developing heart failure or making it worse. Researchers have also found a strong link between trouble falling or staying asleep and the likelihood of heart failure. One reason may be that insomnia triggers the body's stress response, which could weaken your heart over time. Set yourself up for restful sleep: Stick to a regular sleep/wake schedule. Turn off the TV, computer, and other devices before bedtime. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Avoid alcohol before bedtime and caffeine in the afternoon or evening. Exercise every morning. If you have any type of sleep issue, let your cardiologist know. A sleep specialist can help you figure out what's going on medically, whether you're dealing with insomnia or OSA or something else, and how to treat it. One option might be continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) -- a small machine that pumps air through a tube and mask that you wear over your mouth and nose to help keep your airway open at night. There may not always be an easy solution, but sleep is too important to your heart and to your health in general to go without your ZZZs."

        "context": "It's normal to feel tired when you have multiple sclerosis ( MS). MS itself can make you tired. Or you could have another disorder that makes it hard for you to sleep. Insomnia, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, and other sleep problems happen more often in people with MS. In fact, while sleep apnea only affects about 3% of Americans overall, between 4% and 20% of people with MS have it. Sleep apnea can make you feel tired during the day. It also raises your risk of conditions like heart disease and diabetes. The right treatment can help you breathe easier, sleep better, and feel more alert during the day. When you have sleep apnea, your airway becomes blocked while you sleep. This causes you to stop breathing over and over again. That wakes up your brain to restart your breathing. When you wake up that often during the night, you can't get a good night's sleep. Sleep apnea happens more often in people who are overweight. The extra tissue falls over your windpipe while you sleep, so less air gets into your lungs. MS can make you feel too tired to exercise. Both a lack of activity and the steroid drugs you might take to control MS can cause weight gain. Sleep apnea is very common in people with MS for another reason. MS attacks myelin -- the coating that surrounds and protects nerve cells. It leaves behind scars called lesions in your brain and spinal cord. Damage from MS can make it harder for your brain to control your breathing while you sleep. Snoring is a common sign of sleep apnea. If you or your bed partner notices that you snore, choke, or gasp during the night, see your doctor. Other signs of sleep apnea are: Dry mouth when you wake up Feeling tired in the daytime Headaches in the morning Mood swings and irritability Trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating During the exam, your doctor will check your mouth, nose, and throat. You might also have a sleep study to find out for sure if you have sleep apnea and, if so, how severe it is. You'll stay overnight in a lab or use a device at home to monitor your breathing while you sleep. Sleep apnea can do more than make you feel tired during the day. If you don't treat it, it can increase your risk for the following: Accidents, such as car accidents Diabetes Heart attack Heart failure High blood pressure Irregular heartbeat Obesity Stroke It can also affect your memory and make it harder for you to think clearly. The main treatment is continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP). You wear a mask over your nose and mouth while you sleep, and a machine gently blows air into your throat. This keeps your airway open during the night. Your doctor can help you find the right type of CPAP machine and mask. Some masks are hard to fasten, which could be a problem if you have weakness or numbness in your hands. If you have damage to nerves in your face, choose a mask that doesn't put too much pressure there. Another sleep apnea treatment is a mouthpiece called an oral appliance. This moves your lower jaw and tongue to keep your airway open. A dentist or orthodontist can fit you for one. A few changes to your daily routine can also help treat sleep apnea: If you're overweight, lose weight with diet and exercise. To keep your airway open, sleep on your side instead of your back. You can buy a special pillow to stop you from rolling over. If you smoke, ask your doctor for tips to help you quit. Smoking can make sleep apnea worse. Go over all the medicines you take with your doctor. Ask if any of your MS drugs might affect your breathing at night. If so, see if you can switch to another medicine."

When you meet someone for the first time, connect the person's name to an image in your mind. With a man named Bob, you might imagine someone bobbing for apples. The name April could bring to mind a spring tree in bloom. Repeat new names and facts. Saying the words out loud will help them stick in your mind. Take your time. It's harder to remember when you're rushed or under stress. When you learn something new, take a deep breath, pause, and concentrate on it for a few seconds. Work on one task at a time. Turn off distractions like the TV, radio, and cell phone so you can concentrate. \" Exercise\" your brain. Read challenging books, do crossword puzzles, or play word games. Research suggests that people with MS who keep up that kind of mental activity have less trouble learning and remembering. Play games. Over the last few years, many \"train-your-brain\" computer programs have popped up on the Internet. Although the research on brain training is new, it's encouraging. Studies show it might improve short-term memory. One study even showed that playing a racing video game helped improve focus and memory. But more research is needed to see if it really helps."

        "context": "If you have pain below the beltline, you need to find out why you're hurting. Some things might just need a simple treatment. Others might need more serious medical attention. The most common cause of groin pain is a muscle, ligament, or tendon strain. This happens to a lot of men who play sports. The pain may happen right away or build over time. Continuing the sport or activity may make the injury worse. Rest, anti-inflammatory medications (aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen), rehabilitation, and strengthening exercises can often treat the problem successfully. There are other conditions that can cause groin pain. Common ones include: Inguinal hernia: This happens when fat or a loop of your intestine pushes through a weak spot in the muscles of your lower abdomen (belly). You may see a bulge in your groin or scrotum. One quarter of all men will develop this problem sometime during their lifetime. If the intestine or fat gets stuck in the abdominal muscle wall, its blood supply may get cut off. That's called a strangulated hernia. Symptoms can include: Redness or sudden pain near the bulge You can't poop or pass gas Nausea, vomiting, fever Get urgent care if you have any of these symptoms. A strangulated hernia is a life-threatening emergency. The hernia can be fixed with surgery. Prostatitis: This is swelling or infection in your prostate gland. In addition to pain, you may have a hard time peeing. See your doctor. Prostatitis can sometimes go away on its own. But if it's caused by an infection, you may need to take antibiotics. Epididymitis: This is swelling in the tube where sperm is stored -- the epididymis. Most often, an infection causes the problem. Signs and symptoms can include: Pain on one side of the scrotum that comes on slowly. Pain while peeing Fever Milky discharge from your penis Orchitis: It's swelling in one or both testicles. The same infection that's behind epididymitis may cause this problem. The two conditions can happen at the same time. Sometimes, the mumps virus triggers orchitis. It can cause fertility problems. If bacteria is the cause of either condition, an antibiotic can clear it up. Testicular torsion: This happens when a testicle gets twisted inside your scrotum. It may feel like you got kicked in the crotch. It's a medical emergency. The twisting (torsion) cuts off the blood supply to your testicle. If it's not surgically untwisted within a few hours, your testicle can die. It happens most often in teen boys. Testicular cancer: Most of the time, this cancer causes a painless lump in or on your testicle. But sometimes, it's painful. It's not a common cancer. If it's found early, it's almost always treated and cured. Hip problems: Sometimes, hip pain from arthritis or another problem can radiate to your groin. It usually builds slowly and may feel worse when you're driving or sitting in a low chair. Usually, physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications are tried first to treat the problem. You may need an operation if these don't work. Kidney stones: These are small crystals that form in your kidney and can get stuck in tubes leading to your bladder. The pain can be severe. It's usually in your back or belly but can be felt in your scrotum or at the tip of your penis. If the stone is really big, you may need surgery. Kidney infection: This usually happens when an infection travels from your bladder and enters one or both of your kidneys. Symptoms may include groin pain, frequent urination, and blood or pus in your pee. The bacterium called E. coli is often to blame. Kidney infections are treated with antibiotics. The groin pain is very bad or it doesn't get better in a few days There's swelling or a lump around or in your testicle Pain in your side moves into your groin and testicle There's blood in your urine Go to the emergency room if you have sudden or intense pain; the pain radiates to you back, abdomen, or chest; or you have pain along with fever, chills, and nausea."

It's called Lhermitte's sign, or barber chair sign, and it's often one of the symptoms that people mention when they're first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The problem can be painful, but it's not life-threatening. With time or with treatment, some people stop having Lhermitte's sign. When you have MS, your immune system begins to attack the fatty coating, called myelin, that protects your nerves. Without it, scar tissue forms and begins to block the messages traveling in your brain and spinal cord. Lhermitte's sign is one of the symptoms that happens when those signals don't move like they should. MS is not the only condition that can cause Lhermitte's. It can also happen to people with other disorders involving the upper part of the spinal cord, and to people with a severe lack of vitamin B12. Your doctor will want to test you to see if MS or another health problem is causing your symptoms. Like a lot of MS symptoms, you're more likely to trigger Lhermitte's sign if you're tired or overheated. It can also happen if you move your head the wrong way, often when your chin hits your chest. Your doctor may prescribe a few treatments to help relieve your pain: Electrical stimulating devices. These machines ease pain by sending low-voltage electricity to your nerves. Some work from outside your body, such as TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). Others your doctor can implant inside you.

        "context": "This is a kind of skin cancer that affects the upper layer (epidermis) of your skin. Another name for it is squamous cell carcinoma in situ. \u00e2\u0080\u009c In situ\u00e2\u0080\u009d means the cancer \u00e2\u0080\u009csits in\u00e2\u0080\u009d the upper layer and hasn't spread into deeper ones. It usually affects white adults over age 60. Men seem to get it more often than women. Bowen's disease causes reddish, sometimes brown, patches on sun-damaged skin, most often on your legs. You may also see the patches on your head, neck, palms of your hands, and soles of your feet. Sometimes they develop around the genitals. Most people develop only one patch, but you can have several of them. They usually don't cause any discomfort, but they may be: Flat Larger than a half-inch wide Scaly Crusty Oozing Itchy Sore Patches that appear on the genitals can cause problems. In that area, Bowen's disease may be called one of the following: Bowenoid papulosis: This affects both men and women and causes lesions in the genital area. They can last from 2 weeks to several years. Erythroplasia of Queyrat: This affects the tip of a man's penis. It may cause ulcers as well as discharge, bleeding, itching, or pain when peeing. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia ( VIN): In women, it may cause velvety, bright red patches that itch or burn. The itching can become severe. Bowenoid papulosis is caused by HPV (human papillomavirus), which also can cause genital warts and cervical cancer. The virus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U. S. Sexually active people under 30 are at the highest risk for it, because it's most often passed through skin-to-skin contact. Scientists aren't sure exactly what causes the other forms of Bowen's disease. However, long-term sun exposure and aging may increase your odds of getting many skin cancers, including this one. Poisoning with arsenic also appears to make you more likely to get this early form of skin cancer. You can't always tell by looking at your skin if you have Bowen's disease. Many other skin conditions can look the same. It can be mistaken for harmless disorders -- like rashes or eczema -- as well as life-threatening ones, including melanoma. Your doctor usually has to take a sample of your skin for testing (biopsy) to confirm it. Bowen's disease can spread to deeper layers of your skin. Your doctor (a dermatologist, who specializes in skin care and treatment) probably will recommend something called surgical excision. She'll gently remove the cancerous area and about a quarter-inch beyond it. If you have a larger patch, you may need a more detailed procedure called Mohs surgery. A thin layer of tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope. If cancer cells are seen in the outside edges of the tissue, another thin layer is removed and studied. When no cancer cells are found, the surgery is over. Besides surgery, other treatment options are: Curettage and electrodessication: You're given a shot of anesthetic to numb the area, and your doctor scrapes off the patches with a special tool. Then she'll use high-frequency electric current to stop the bleeding. She may repeat the process if there are still cancer cells in deeper tissue. Fluorouracil: This is medication you put on your skin. It keeps the abnormal cells from growing and reproducing. It can cause redness, soreness, or peeling after 1 or 2 weeks, but this usually goes away within a month or two. Imiquimod: This is also medication you put on your skin. Doctors don't know exactly how it works against cancer, but when it's used to treat warts, it helps your immune system fight the virus that causes them. Liquid nitrogen cryosurgery: Your doctor sprays liquid nitrogen onto the affected area to freeze it. Afterward, the area will peel, blister, or scab over, depending on the amount used. Laser removal: Your doctor will use light energy (photons) to burn off the area. Photodynamic (\u00e2\u0080\u009clight\u00e2\u0080\u009d) therapy: This uses ultraviolet light rays to heal your skin. Sometimes you may put medication on your skin to make the cells more sensitive to the light. Radiation therapy: One type uses very tiny electrically charged particles (electrons) to target and kill cancer cells. This type of radiation enters only the upper layers of your skin, so deeper tissues and organs are safe. If you have Bowen's disease, you're at a higher risk for other types of skin cancers, especially if you have a weak immune system from disease or medical treatments. You should have regular follow-ups and skin checks with your doctor."

        "context": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) and autism can look a lot like each other. Children with either condition can have problems focusing. They can be impulsive or have a hard time communicating. They may have trouble with schoolwork and with relationships. Although they share many of the same symptoms, the two are distinct conditions. Autism spectrum disorders are a series of related developmental disorders that can affect language skills, behavior, social interactions, and the ability to learn. ADHD impacts the way the brain grows and develops. And you can have both. The correct diagnosis early on helps children get the right treatment so they don't miss out on important development and learning. People with these conditions can have successful, happy lives. Keep an eye on how your child pays attention. Those with autism struggle to focus on things that they don't like, such as reading a book or doing a puzzle. And they may fixate on things that they do like, such as playing with a particular toy. Kids with ADHD lose initial interest, and they dislike and avoid things they'll have to concentrate on. You should also study how your child is learning to communicate. Although kids with either condition struggle to interact with others, those with autism tend to be self-centered. They often have a hard time putting words to their thoughts and feelings, and they may not be able to point to an object to give meaning to their speech. They find it hard to make eye contact. A child with ADHD, on the other hand, may talk nonstop. They're more likely to interrupt when someone else is speaking or butt in and try to monopolize a conversation. Also, consider the subject. Some kids with autism can talk for hours about a topic that they're interested in. An autistic child loves order and repetition, but one with ADHD doesn't, even if it helps them. A child with autism might want the same type of food at a favorite restaurant, for instance, or become overly attached to one toy or shirt. They'll become upset when routines change. A child with ADHD doesn't like doing the same thing again or for long times. If you think your child has either ADHD or autism, talk to your doctor about what testing you'll need. There's no one thing that can say whether a child has either condition, or both. You can start with your pediatrician, who may refer you to a specialist. To diagnose ADHD, doctors look for a pattern of behaviors over time like being distracted or forgetful, not following through, having trouble waiting for a turn, and fidgeting or squirming. They'll ask for feedback from parents, teachers, and other adults that care for the child. A doctor will also try to rule out other possible causes for the symptoms. An autism diagnosis starts with a parent answering a questionnaire about the child, often about behaviors that started when they were very young. Further tests and tools may include more questionnaires, surveys, and checklists, as well as interviews and observed activities. It can be hard for even doctors to tell the conditions apart, but it's important so your child gets the right treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all way to deal with ADHD. Younger kids start with behavior therapy, and the doctor may prescribe medication if symptoms don't improve enough. Older kids will usually get both. ADHD symptoms, and their treatment, may change over time. Different kinds of therapy -- behavior, speech, sensory integration, and occupational, for example -- can help kids with autism communicate and get along better. Medicine can't cure autism, but it may make related symptoms like difficulty focusing or high energy easier to deal with."

        "context": "Sex is supposed to be enjoyable, but it's tough to have fun if you're constantly worrying about how well you're doing. If you want to put the sparkle back in your love life, learn why sexual performance anxiety might be happening to you and get some tips to put yourself at ease. Sex is more than just a physical response. Your emotions have something to do with it, too. When your mind is too stressed out to focus on sex, your body can't get excited either. Lots of different worries can lead to the problem: Fear that you won't perform well in bed and satisfy your partner sexually Poor body image, including concern over your weight Problems in your relationship Worry that your penis won't \"measure up\" Concern about ejaculating too early or taking too long to reach orgasm Anxiety about not being able to have an orgasm or enjoy the sexual experience These things may lead your body to release stress hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine. Your state of mind can have a big impact on your ability to get aroused. Even if you're with someone who you find sexually appealing, worrying about whether you'll be able to please your partner can make it impossible for you to do just that. One of the effects of the stress hormones is to narrow blood vessels. When less blood flows into your penis, it's more difficult to have an erection. Even guys who normally don't have any trouble getting excited might not be able to get an erection when they're overcome by sexual performance anxiety. Sexual performance anxiety isn't diagnosed as often in women as it is in men, but it can affect arousal in women, too. Anxiety can prevent women from getting lubricated enough to have sex, and it can take away the physical desire to make love. Anxiety can take you out of the right mind-set for sex. When you're focused on whether you'll perform well, you can't concentrate on what you're doing in bed. Even if you are able to get aroused, you may be too distracted to reach orgasm. Sexual performance anxiety leads to a cycle of troubles. You might become so anxious about sex that you can't perform, which leads to even more sexual performance anxiety. If you've got sexual performance anxiety, see a doctor -- someone you're comfortable enough with to discuss your sex life. The doctor will examine you and do some tests to make sure a health condition or medication isn't the cause of your problems. During the exam your doctor will ask about your sexual history to find out how long you've had sexual performance anxiety and what kinds of thoughts are interfering with your sex life. Medications and other therapies can help treat erectile dysfunction and other sexual problems that have physical causes. If a medical issue isn't to blame, your doctor might suggest you try one of these approaches: Talk to a therapist. Make an appointment with a counselor or therapist who has experience in treating sexual problems. Therapy can help you understand and then reduce or get rid of the issues that are causing your sexual performance anxiety. If you worry about premature ejaculation, for example, you can try some techniques that help you gain more control. Be open with your partner. Talking with your partner about your anxiety can help ease some of your worries. When you try to reach a solution together, you may draw closer as a couple and improve your sexual relationship. Get intimate in other ways. Learn how to be intimate without sexual intercourse. Give your partner a sensual massage or take a warm bath together. Take turns pleasing each other with masturbation so you don't always have to feel pressured to perform sexually. Exercise . Not only does working out make you feel better about your body, it also improves your stamina in bed. Distract yourself. Put on some romantic music or a sexy movie while you make love. Think about something that turns you on. Taking your mind off your sexual performance can remove the worries that stop you from getting excited. Finally, take it easy on yourself. Don't beat yourself up about your appearance or ability in bed. Get help for sexual performance anxiety so you can get back to having a healthy and enjoyable sex life."
